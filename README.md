# DataQuest-Efficient-SQL-Queries-for-Large-Databases-
"DataQuest: Efficient SQL Queries for Large Databases" is a project aimed at refining SQL queries to efficiently handle large datasets. It offers insights and strategies for optimizing query performance, utilizing indexes effectively, and improving overall data retrieval processes in relational database environments.

Problem Statement:
The task is to retrieve details about customers by querying a database. This involves extracting information such as customer names, contact information, purchase history, and any other relevant data stored in the database. The goal is to formulate SQL queries that efficiently fetch the required customer details while adhering to best practices for database querying and optimization.

Topics:
1. Database Setup: Downloading the database and restoring it on the server.
2. SQL Queries: Writing queries to extract customer details such as name, phone number, and email ID.
3. Sales Analysis: Querying the database to retrieve sales data for a particular month, calculate the increase in month-on-month sales, and determine the total sales made to a specific customer.
4. Query Optimization: Optimizing queries for efficient data retrieval and performance.
5. Reporting: Generating reports based on the extracted customer details and sales analysis.
6. Conclusion: Summarizing the project outcomes and any insights gained from the database queries.

Highlights:
1. Table Basics and Data Types: Understanding fundamental concepts of database tables, including creating and managing tables, as well as different data types such as VARCHAR, INTEGER, DATE, etc.
2. Various SQL Operators: Exploring SQL operators like arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=), logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), and wildcard operators (LIKE, IN, BETWEEN).
3. Various SQL Functions: Learning about SQL functions such as aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN), string functions (SUBSTRING, CONCAT, LENGTH), date functions (DATEADD, DATEDIFF, DATEPART), and conversion functions (CAST, CONVERT).

Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Download the AdventureWorks database from the following location and restore it in your server:

Dataset:
https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks
File Name: AdventureWorks2012.bak

2. To restore the AdventureWorks database using SQL Server Management Studio:

a. Open SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the target SQL Server instance. In the Object Explorer pane, expand the "Databases" node.
b. Right-click on the "Databases" node and select "Restore Database..." from the context menu.
c. In the "Restore Database" window, select the "Device" option.Click on the ellipsis (...) button next to the "Device" field to open the "Select backup devices" dialog box.
d. In the "Select backup devices" dialog box, select "Backup devices", click "Add", navigate to the database backup in the file system of the server, select the backup, and click "OK".
e. Back in the "Restore Database" window, you should now see the selected backup file listed under the "Backup sets to restore" section.
f. Optionally, if needed, change the target location for the data and log files in the "Files" pane. It's recommended to place data and log files on different drives.
g. Click "OK" to initiate the database restore. Once completed, the AdventureWorks database will be installed on your SQL Server instance.

3. For querying the AdventureWorks database, perform the following tasks:

a. Retrieve all details from the person table including email ID, phone number, and phone number type.
b. Obtain details of sales header orders made in May 2011.
c. Fetch details of sales detail orders made in the month of May 2011.
d. Calculate the total sales made in May 2011.
e. Determine the total sales made in the year 2011 by month, ordered by increasing sales.
f. Retrieve the total sales made to the customer with FirstName='Gustavo' and LastName='Achong'.
